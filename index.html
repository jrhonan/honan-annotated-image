    <div class="container text">
      <p>Since 2018, Queens barber Peter Musca had been wanting to turn his barber shop into a mobile barber business, but he needed a push. Every time he saw a sprinter van or Amazon delivery truck drive by his shop Clippers on Metropolitan Avenue in Middle Village, he would fantasize about driving around the neighborhood to service his clients. He never expected that two years later he would be trading in the keys to his shop for keys to a van. </p>

      <p>When New York City announced all non-essential businesses including barber shops would have to close in March of 2020, Musca didn’t expect the shut down to last as long as it. “Something would have to happen where I didn’t have my shop no more and I’d have to take the risk. I always thought about renewing my lease and staying there for another 10 years,” says Musca. “ Since COVID hit and shook up the whole world, how everyone does things. There’s my scapegoat.”</p>
